                    <h2>What is Data Structure?</h2>
                    <p>
Data Structure is a systematic way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently. For example arrays,
 Linked List, Stack, Queue, etc. are data structures. Whether it is Operating System, Compiler Design, Artificial 
 intelligence, Graphics or anything else, Data structure is useful in every aspect of computer science. Data structure 
 is associated with algorithms that allows programmers to handle data in efficient ways and enhance the performance of
  the application.
